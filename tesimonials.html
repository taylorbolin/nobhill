          <p><em>"We bought the newly constructed shell of the premiere
          penthouse in the new Ritz Carlton Club & Residences and needed a
          great deal of help because, quite frankly, we were rookies, and the
          architectural firm we had selected disappointed us. (Seven different
          architects worked as our lead architects during the project!) Nob
          Hill Construction more than filled in the missing pieces with
          in-house expertise.</em></p>
          <br>
          <p><em>Our project was different than many because during the project
          we introduced architecturally salvaged items we wanted incorporated
          into the construction, replacing meticulous plans already given to
          them. This presented no problem to anyone at Nob Hill Construction
          and made for what the workers said was one of their more interesting
          jobs. In hindsight, I cannot think of anything that would fluster
          these gentlemen/women - they can figure things out. The craftsmen on
          the project made many "off plan" recommendations that we followed,
          using their expertise as high-end high-rise construction
          experts.</em></p>
          <br>
          <p><em>My wife worked very closely with the whole Nob Hill
          Construction team, usually visiting the site every other week, which
          meant that we saved a great deal on change orders that never had to
          happen, and the craftsmen on the job were very accommodating and
          encouraged her involvement, rather than resenting it.</em></p>
          <br>
          <p><em>If I were to do another project in the San Francisco area
          requiring the best possible construction team, I would most certainly
          call Nob Hill Construction first and even agree to a time and
          materials arrangement, as they are "straight shooters" and I would
          not need to look over my shoulder. They were sensitive to our budget
          and would be again on another project, I am sure.</em></p>
          <br>
          <p><em>No, I am not related to anyone at Nob Hill Construction! The
          reason for my extremely positive recommendation is that we truly had
          a very favorable co-development experience and would welcome the
          opportunity to work with them again."</em></p><br>

          paying extraordinary attention to the details. All this is backed by
          a project management system that involves the architect and the
          client in the construction process making certain the finished
          product is on time and within budget."</em></p><br>

          <p><em>"Nob Hill Construction just finished a completely gutted
          remodel of my San Francisco condo. All I can say is WOW! They were
          also highly endorsed by many of the other residents in my building as
          well as the concierges, who hold up Nob Hill Construction as the role
          model to other construction vendors. The design department is bright,
          highly creative, professional, and is the calming influence during
          the upheaval of remodeling.</em></p>
          <br>
          <p><em>Many of the residents have seen our newly remodeled condo.
          They were so impressed with the quality of the work and design that
          two of the residents want to buy the condo when we’re ready to sell
          it, which won’t be for a long time… We love it! I highly recommend
          and endorse the Nob Hill Construction team. They are professional,
          hard working, committed, flexible, and strive for the highest
          quality. In addition, they bring the project in on time and on
          budget. When I take on our next remodel, they will be the only
          company I call!"</em></p><br>
