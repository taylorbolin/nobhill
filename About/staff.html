				<h2>Aaron Gordon</h2>
									<p class="position">Owner</p>
				<p>After his first construction project, a tree house when he was a kid, Aaron knew he was onto something. In the time between that tree house and founding AGC Aaron worked for his father manufacturing speakers in the car audio industry. There he developed his instincts for business, and went on to earn a business degree from Sonoma State University to greaten his knowledge of business. Following graduation he worked as a stage hand and set builder. During this time he started doing small construction projects in his spare time. These became larger in scope and more frequent until Aaron eventually decided to get his general contractor’s license and combine his passion for building with his passion for running a business. He has never looked back. When he’s not working Aaron spends time with his wife and son, goes camping, plays tennis, and thinks business.</p>

				<p>Brian leads the team that creates project budgets and schedules. Before construction he works with clients, architects, designers, and the AGC team to align client expectations, architect vision, and construction logistics to prepare for successful projects.

Now he leverages his years of experience and deep knowledge of building to oversee production at AGC. He coaches AGC foremen and crew, ensures construction quality, manages trade contractors, and makes sure challenges are anticipated and provisioned for before they can become problems. Outside of work Eric enjoys spending time with his wife and two sons, playing music, and making sculpture.</p>

				<h2>Amber Stitt</h2>
									<p class="position">Estimator</p>
				<p>Amber received her undergraduate degree in International Studies at Cal State, East Bay. After college, she began working as a painter for a general contractor. She moved on to carpentry, after noticing that carpenters seemed most involved in the remodel process, experiencing a large variety of work. After working at AGC as a carpenter, it quickly became clear that her expertise and diligence would be suited for an estimator. As is the case with the best estimators, her hands-on carpentry experience informs her ability to estimate costs. In her free time, she follows and plays sports and performs with her band.</p>

				<h2>Dominic Buschiazzo</h2>
									<p class="position">Foreman</p>
				<p>Growing up with a father in the contracting business, Dominic knew carpentry was “always something in the back of my mind that I could do.” Since then, he has seen the carpentry world change immensely as technology transformed construction processes. Now, better structural planning and waterproofing requires more foresight and leads to more longevity for the project. Recently, he picked up archery with AGC’s estimator, Brian Dutro. He also collects records and has been a DJ for 25 years.</p>

				<h2>Brian Timmerman</h2>
									<p class="position">Carpenter</p>
				<p>Brian is one AGC’s veteran carpenters. He enjoys carpentry because he likes the hands-on aspect of it, being outside in the fresh air, and constantly changing the type of work day-to-day. Every job is different, every problem has a different solution, and you never stop learning. Brian also writes music, plays bass, guitar, and synthesizer, and goes to as many shows as he can.</p>

				<h2>Jason Mann</h2>
									<p class="position">Carpenter</p>
				<p>For the past 20 years before being hired at AGC, Jason owned and operated a real estate office with his brother. However, Jason had always built furniture as a hobby and decided he’d like to pursue a career in construction rather than his office job. Jason likes to run and watch a ton of baseball. He is an avid San Francisco Giants fan, but with family in Kansas City, he thoroughly enjoyed the 2014 World Series.</p>
